# Experiment-4
## Aim:
To code a program to print even numbers between 1-20.
## Algotrithm:
1.Import the packages.
2.Using for loop do the operation.
3.Inside that insert the if condition.
## Code:
```
public class evennum{
     public static void main(String[] args){
    for (int i = 1; i < 20; i++) {
            if (i % 2 != 1) {
                System.out.println(i);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
## Output:
